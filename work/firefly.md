Firefly sync is a simple program for synchronous flashing of fireflies.
The model of program consists of a population of identical
fireflies having same time priod for flashing. 

However, the coupling between fireflies is pulsatile,
that means when a given firfly fires, 
it pulls the others up by a fixed amount, or brings them to the 
lighting threshold, whichever is less.

The main result is that for almost all initial conditions,
the population evolves to a state in which all the fireflies 
are flashing synchronously.
