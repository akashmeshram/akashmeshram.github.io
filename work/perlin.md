In this program stochastically chosen points are used for noise field generation.
This field is also coupled with trignometric functions to give it more turning feel.

Perlin Noise is an extremely powerful algorithm that is used often in procedural content generation.
It has a more organic appearance because it produces a naturally ordered (“smooth”) sequence of pseudo-random numbers.
