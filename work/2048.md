2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game.
The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. However, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers.

How to play: Click on direction buttons to move the tiles. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one!
