This program generates a structure which looks like a butterfly in one plane and an owl mask in another.
It has following story :-

An American mathematician, Edward Lorenz was once looking for a way to model the action of the chaotic behavior of the gaseous system first mentioned above. Lorenz took a few "Navier-Stokes" equations, from the physics field of fluid dynamics. He simplified them and got as a result the following three-dimensional system:

dx/dt = delta * (y - x)

dy/dt = r * x - y - x * z

dz/dt = x * y - b * z

Plotting the three differential equations generates a structure which weaves in and out of itself,
the structure now is known as the Lorenz Attractor.
