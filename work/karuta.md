The Ogura Hyakunin Isshu (小倉百人一首), often simply called Hyakunin Isshu (lit. "One Hundred Poets, One Poem Each") or Hundred Poets, is a collection of 100 traditional Japanese poems by 100 Japanese poets.

The Ogura Hyakunin Isshu was completed during the Kamakura period. Fujiwara no Teika compiled them by taking one poem each from hundred of the best poets in chronological order from Emperor Tenji to the Retired Emperor Juntoku to decorate the sliding doors at the Ogura mountain villa, the summer home of the general and poet Utsunomiya Yoritsuna.

You can feel the seasons and modesty in ways that can't be found in modern poetry!
