Sebastien Truchet was a french priest who generated  patterns formed by tilings
of right triangles oriented at the four corners of a square. 

This program is it's modification, it uses only two tiles each consisting of orthogonal digonal line 
to generate patterns. It is similar to "10 PRINT" design.
