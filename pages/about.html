			<p>Hello! <br> I am Akash Meshram.
			A current junior at IIT Kharagpur interested in interdisciplinary technology and lover of the color blue. 
			I aspire to use my skills to create better human experiences and integration with the natural world. <!-- Visual intuition and engineering education are key ingredients of my work. --> In my free time, I enjoy searching for the historical facts, travelling, admiring tech and consuming samosa.  I'm currently moving my works from forgotten drive folders to this (hopefully) much more organized site, so bear with me please!
